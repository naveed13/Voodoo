Voodoo Donut Demand

1. Read the Assignment few times to understand the objective.
2. Skectched the problem on paper.
3. Listed all possible Inputs. (attributes)
4. Listed all possible functions to avoid repetition in code.(methods)
5. Made a flow chart on paper to see how the inputs will flow and what output will we get at each stage.
6. Made kind of a Pseudocode.
7. Started coding with frequent use of console.log to ensure the flow.
8. Got the correct output from javascript part of the assignment, except was not able to get the total donuts for each place.
9. Later realized assignment was specific to use of constructor function so changed the code so it was using the constructor function and my issue related to total number of donusts per day was also fixed since function ran on each location and previously i was running time forloop on [places].
10. Now wanted to print the output thru html file.
11. After being pointed to the right direction by Ryan Sobol and discussing with Nicholas Peters was able to get the first draft of html output which does not look pretty at all. (Feb 9 2015)
